# SonoranGardenerAndroidApp
The Sonoran Gardener app for Android API 16 and up. This is an MVP of the Sonoran Gardener app (see
development status updates at blog.sonorangardener.com). Sonoran Gardener is a pilot project
for The Pineapple Project (ThePineappleProject.org).

## Design Notes
- Going to try out the new Material Design elements introduced with Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21)
for this app, using the v7 library compatibility for earlier versions of Android.
- The target devices for this app are expected to be relatively new as most users have service plans
that keep their handsets/tablets up-to-date, so the Min SDK was selected to be API 16 (Android 4.1
Jelly Bean). API 16 introduced a number of new libraries to Android, so it makes a good baseline
and the Android dashboard (developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) states that API 16 will
support 85.1% of the devices currently active on Google servers.
